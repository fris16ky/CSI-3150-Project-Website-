          <h1>Well, so here are all of my ideas (reasonable and not) for this
          project:</h1
          <menu>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Working Calendar for each month (up to the first few years)
              </li>
              <li>
                Be able to click on any day 'box' on a calendar and navigate -
                view already-set reminders and a blue button to set another.
                Will need to know how to do the extra credit in HW 1 for this
              </li>
              <li>
                From the calendar page, be able to set (and delete/edit)
                reminders there
              </li>
              <li>
                Maybe implement an alarm feature - a countdown that you can set,
                when it reaches the end, directs you to a page or a pop-up with
                the alarm and the alarm message. And maybe plays an alarm noise
              </li>
              <li>
                How will reminders work. Will they be emails sent to customers,
                or pop-up notifications? If so, there will need to be a 'I've
                done this' button (complete sounds good), maybe a 'remind me
                again in 1 hour' button next to complete.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ability to set recurring reminders. Once a week on Tuesday at 5pm, eat
                carrots. idk
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>
                    So maybe, unless I find a noice other idea, have an arrow in the 
                    top right of the calendar, and whenever you want to go forward or
                    backward in a calendar (like go forward or backward a month), you 
                    click the arrow and that'll send you to a new page? But that would 
                    be a lot of pages. Maybe only do it for up to 1 year ish? Or figure
                    out how to make it infinite
              </b>
