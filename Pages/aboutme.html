      Well, I have been in coding classes since my Junior year in High School,
      where I took AP Computer Science. I was instantly intrigued and fell in
      love with all that coding can offer. As soon as I graduated and went to
      University, I knew my major had to be in Computer Science. Ever since
      then, I've learned a plethora of new and intriguing languages, including
      (if you count it), html which I am enjoying thoroughly. For things not
      related to CS, I have a few hobbies and interests:
      <li>
        Sports - I played baseball for around 11 years and enjoy it more than I
        can express. I constantly am watching and studying Baseball, Basketball,
        and Football with the occasional Soccer game.
      </li>
      <li>
        Video Games - I have been gaming nearly as long, where I have fallen in
        love with many different genres of games - puzzle-based, first person
        shooters, sandbox (creative-based where the possibilites are endless),
        and of course sports games.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading - James Patterson and his specialty of mystery has always
        captivated me. I was a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, Manga and fell in
        love with the Percy Jackson series and spinoffs, which developed my love
        for mythology
      </li>
      <li>
        Traveling - I am blessed to say that I have visited a decent amount of
        European countries, all of which have been breath-taking. Something
        about venturing out into something new fascinates me. The endless
        exploration and natural beauties that you can find while traveling are
        to die for.
