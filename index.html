        This project stems from a midterm project of my CSI 3150 - Web and
        Mobile Systems class in conjunction with my affinity for Google Calendar
        and its functions; hence the name.

              Meet Mia! I must admit, there may be some false advertising as Mia
              is a Bolognese breed, not a poodle.

            <p>
              Mia is featured in a majority of the Puppy Slideshow, along with
              my friend's dog Charlotte, my grandparent's puppy Emme, and some
              landscape shots that I took myself.

            <h2>About this project</h2>
            <p>
              I will say, developing and executing this project was more
              daunting than I initially thought it would be. Nonetheless, this
              was still a lot of fun to make. For myself, I am a senior at
              Oakland University and a major in Computer Science. I have been
              mesmorized by technology since a young age; the possibilities are
              truly endless and I learn new things every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I touched on earlier, I am an avid user of Google Calendar. I
              have had a Google phone for around the last 6 years, and genuinely
              use the reminder feature everyday. I tried my hardest to emulate
              such a feature, but settled for an agenda-esq design. I hope the
              website, especially the plethora of puppies, is acceptable.
