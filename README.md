# Poodle Scheduler - an Agenda-based Website
This website was one half of a semester-long project for my CSI 3150 - Web and Mobile Systems course. 
For this portion, we were required to use the bases of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a dynamic website of our choosing.


Having had 2 Google Phones in the past, and many gmail accounts, I decided on this topic stemming from my love of the Google Calendar system. 
I added my own spice with weaving my love for photography and dogs into it, creating a slideshow to ease the mmonotony that comes with calendars. 
Enjoy!
